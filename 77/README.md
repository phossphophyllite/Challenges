The point of this project was to teach myself about convolution, which it did. It works, somewhat, but is very slow and not at all robust. Does allow for some modularity in the layer design. If anyone ever sees this I might put documentation together. Down the line I'll probably refactor it completely and see if I can get it working at the level of an actual ResNET implementation.

This project has taught me exactly three things:
1) Don't take pytorch for granted
2) Don't take scipy for granted
3) Don't take numpy for granted
